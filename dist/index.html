            <p>Welcome to Black Jack!</p>
            <p>This is a card game in which the winner is whoever gets rid of all their cards first!</p>
            <p>Each player takes it in turns to either play a card or pickup a card. If you can't play, you must pick up
                a card</p>
            <p>You can only place a card that is matching in suit or in value.</p>
            <p>Some played cards will have affect the game:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A 2 means the next player picks up 2 and misses a go</li>
                <li>An 8 means the next player misses a go</li>
                <li>A 10 means the play direction is reversed</li>
                <li>A black jack means the next player picks up 7 and misses a go</li>
                <li>A king means you can take another turn</li>
                <li>An Ace means you can changes suits (not yet implemented)</li>
                <li>A red jack means you can cancel a black jack (not yet implemented)</li>
